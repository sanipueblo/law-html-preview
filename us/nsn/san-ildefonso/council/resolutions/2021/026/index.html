                <p>WHEREAS, there is a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents or prices that low income citizens can afford, and that such shortage forces people to occupy unsanitary, unsafe and overcrowded dwelling accommodations or leave the Pueblo; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the establishment of a housing authority will aid in the provision of decent, safe and sanitary housing, will contribute to the overall economic welfare of the Pueblo, will provide employment opportunities for Pueblo members, and will establish desirable housing, neighborhoods, and communities on Pueblo Lands; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo has the authority to undertake the formation of a housing authority for the benefit of the People.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled "THE HOUSING AUTHORITY ACT."</p>
