                <p>
                  <preamble>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 29th day of May, 2019, the following Resolution was adopted:</preamble>
                </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso ("Pueblo') is a sovereign and self-governing Tribe, recognized as such by the United States of America; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the voters of the Pueblo approved a new Governing Agreement ("Agreement") for the Pueblo on November 19, 2011, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved the Agreement on December 21, 2011 pursuant to Federal law; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council is authorized to make laws for the Pueblo pursuant to Section 5 of the Agreement; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, since the adoption of the governing Agreement in 2011, the Election Commission has conducted numerous, successful, undisputed elections to guarantee the right of the voters to select the government officials for the Pueblo; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Election Commission has identified a number of election issues that should be addressed and clarified through the enactment of amendments to the Election Law; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council originally enacted the Election Law in 2012, and enacted amendments to the Election Law in 2016; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Election Commission, Governor's Office, and Council have developed and discussed proposed amendments to the Election Law at length, and the Council has determined that it is in the best interests of the Pueblo to enact amendments to the Election Law to bring further clarity to the election process and to guarantee that elections continue to be conducted in a fair and impartial manner for the benefit of the People.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Council hereby enacts the attached law 	entitled, "ELECTION LAW," as amended and restated.</p>
                <p>CERTIFICATION</p>
                <p>The foregoing resolution was duly voted upon by the Council on May 29, 2019, at a meeting with a vote of 8 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstaining and 2 absent (Governor presiding and not voting) pursuant to the authority vested in the Council by the Agreement of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso.</p>
