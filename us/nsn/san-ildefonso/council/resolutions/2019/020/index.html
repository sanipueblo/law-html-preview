                <p>
                  <preamble>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 14th day of October, 2019, the following Resolution and law were adopted:</preamble>
                </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso ("Pueblo") has identified the need to promote economic development within the Tribe for the benefit of the People; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council established and chartered San Ildefonso Services, LLC, ("SIS, LLC") under tribal law as a single member limited liability company wholly owned by the Pueblo; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS, LLC owns and operates two businesses within the Pueblo lands commonly referred to as the Totavi and White Rock Convenience Stores and Gas Stations ("C-Stores"); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council transferred ownership and operation of the C-Stores to SIS, LLC, effective July 1, 2017, pursuant to the, "Act to Transfer Ownership and Operation of C-Stores to San Ildefonso Services, LLC," dated June 21, 2017; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS, LLC assumed all liabilities, including contracts and accounts, of the C-Stores accrued after July 1, 2017, and SIS, LLC is responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes related to the operation of or otherwise imposed on the C-Stores; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS LLC assumed full responsibility for insuring, maintaining, and repairing the C-Stores; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS, LLC assumed all C-Stores employees and responsibility for payroll, benefits, and related human resources matters for employees of the C-Stores; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, since the July 1, 2017 acquisition of the C-Stores, SIS LLC has endeavored to enhance the operations and profitability of the C-Stores but operational and procurement costs have made this extremely difficult; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on May 21, 2018, SIS LLC presented the C-Stores' financial concerns, along with supporting financial information, to the Council and formally requested that the Pueblo provide a subsidy of $0.06 for every gallon of gasoline sold to allow SIS, LLC to adequately compete in the local C-Store market; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on June 6, 2018, the Council formally approved a subsidy for the benefit of SIS, LLC in the amount of $0.06 for every gallon of gasoline sold in the C-Stores ("Subsidy") pursuant to Council Resolution No. SI-R18-011, titled "Act Approving Tax Subsidy to San Ildefonso Services, LLC" ("Subsidy Act"); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council determined that it is in the Pueblo's best interest to support SIS, LLC and its operation of the C-Stores and to provide the Subsidy, and identified that the Subsidy could be paid from revenues generated by the Pueblo's $0.17 per gallon fuel tax; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Subsidy authorized in the Subsidy Act expired one (1) year from the effective date of the Act, i.e., on June 5, 2019; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS, LLC has requested that the Subsidy continue in force for an additional one (1) year period, effective on June 6, 2019, and expiring on June 5, 2020; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council has determined that it is in the Pueblo's best interests to support SIS, LLC and its operation of the C-Stores by extending the Subsidy for an additional one-year period beginning on June 6, 2019 and expiring on June 5, 2020, and has identified that such subsidy could be paid from revenues generated by the Pueblo's $0.17 per gallon fuel tax.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled, "EXTENSION AND RESTATMENT OF THE ACT APPROVING TAX SUBSIDY TO 	SAN ILDEFONSO SERVICES, LLC."</p>
                <p>CERTIFICATION</p>
                <p>The foregoing resolution was duly voted upon by the Council on October 14, 2019, at a meeting with a vote of 6 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstaining and 4 absent (Governor presiding and not voting) pursuant to the authority vested in the Council by the Agreement of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso.</p>

                <p>The Council hereby finds and declares that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(a)">(a)</span> The Council established and chartered San Ildefonso Services, LLC, ("SIS, LLC") under tribal law as a single member limited liability company wholly by the Pueblo; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(b)">(b)</span> SIS, LLC owns and operates two businesses within Pueblo lands commonly referred to as the Totavi and White Rock Convenience Stores and Gas Stations ("C-Stores"); and</p>
