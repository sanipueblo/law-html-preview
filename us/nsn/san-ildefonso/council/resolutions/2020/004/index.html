                <p>
                  <preamble>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 13th day of May, 2020, the following Resolution was adopted:</preamble>
                </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso ("Pueblo") is a party in the federal water adjudication case of State v. Aamodt, U.S. District Court of New Mexico, No. 66CV6639, and in 2010, the United States enacted 1the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, as part of the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 11-291, Title VI, §§ 601-626, 124 Stat. 3064, 3134-56 (2010), which was signed into law by the President on December 8, 2010 ("Settlement Act" or "Act"); and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Settlement Act requires the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") to plan, design and construct a regional water system to divert and distribute water to four Pueblos and to Santa Fe County; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, Section 611(c) of the Act provides that the Pueblos, State and Santa Fe County shall consent to easements and rights-of-way necessary for the construction use, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Regional Water System; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the four Pueblos and Reclamation agreed that in lieu of the formal grant of easement or right-of-way, the parties will use a construction agreement that delineates construction corridors and other authorized activities within Pueblo lands; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on Dec 20, 2019, the Council authorized signature of a form of the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System Project Construction Agreement; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo had made recommendations on the construction corridors that are an exhibit to the Construction Agreement and was awaiting final response from Reclamation before signing the Construction Agreement; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, during that time and before the Construction Agreement had been signed, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the Pueblo took actions to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect its tribal residents, including restrictions on entrance to the Pueblo's lands by non-tribal visitors, non-essential contractors or vendors; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a COVID-19 Response Plan was developed for all contractors and their employees that will be working on the portion of the Regional Water System within the Pueblo; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the COVID-19 Response Plan is incorporated into Exhibit A of the Construction Agreement which contains specific terms and requirements for safe access to the Pueblo for construction activities and constitutes a substantive change to Exhibit A that requires Council authorization; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council finds it in the best interest of the Pueblo to authorize signature of the Construction Agreement with the amended Exhibit A that contains the COVID-19 Response Plan.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled, "ACT AUTHORIZING SIGNATURE OF THE POJOAQUE BASIN REGIONAL WATER SYSTEM PROJECT CONSTRUCTION AGREEMENT WITH AMENDED 	EXHIBIT A."</p>
                <p>CERTIFICATION</p>
                <p>The foregoing resolution was duly voted upon by the Council on May 13, 2020, at a meeting with a vote of 10 in favor, 0 opposed, 0 abstaining and 0 absent (Governor presiding and not voting) pursuant to the authority vested in the Council by the Agreement of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso.</p>

                <p>The Council hereby declares that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(a)">(a)</span> The Pueblo de San Ildefonso ("Pueblo") is a party in the federal water adjudication 	case of <em>State v. Aamodt</em>, U.S. District Court of New Mexico, No. 66CV6639, and in 2010, the United States enacted the Aamodt Litigation Settlement Act, as part of the Claims Resolution Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 11-291, Title VI, §§ 601-626, 124 Stat. 3064, 3134-56 (2010), which was signed into law by the President on December 8, 2010 ("Settlement Act" or "Act"); and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(b)">(b)</span> The Settlement Act requires the Secretary, acting through the Bureau of Reclamation ("Reclamation") to plan, design and construct a regional water system to divert and distribute water to four Pueblos and to Santa Fe County; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(c)">(c)</span> Section 611(c) of the Act provides that the Pueblos, State and Santa Fe County shall consent to easements and rights-of-way necessary for the construction use, operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the Regional Water System; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(d)">(d)</span> The four Pueblos and Reclamation agreed that in lieu of the formal grant of easement or right-of-way, the parties will use a construction agreement that delineates construction corridors and other authorized activities within Pueblo lands; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(e)">(e)</span> On Dec 20, 2019, the Council authorized signature of a form of the Pojoaque Basin Regional Water System Project Construction Agreement; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(f)">(f)</span> The Pueblo had made recommendations on the construction corridors that are an exhibit to the Construction Agreement and was awaiting final response from Reclamation before signing the Construction Agreement; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(g)">(g)</span> During that time and before the Construction Agreement had been signed, the COVID-19 pandemic hit and the Pueblo took actions to mitigate the spread of the virus and protect its tribal residents, including restrictions on entrance to the Pueblo's lands by non-tribal visitors, non-essential contractors or vendors; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(h)">(h)</span> A COVID-19 Response Plan was developed for all contractors and their employees that will be working on the portion of the Regional Water System within the Pueblo; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(i)">(i)</span> The COVID-19 Response Plan is incorporated into Exhibit A of the Construction Agreement which contains specific terms and requirements for safe access to the Pueblo for construction activities and constitutes a substantive amendment to Exhibit A that requires Council approval and authorization; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(j)">(j)</span> The Council, having reviewed a form of the Construction Agreement and the exhibits thereto, including the amended Exhibit A, finds authorization of the Construction Agreement is in the best interest of this Pueblo.</p>
