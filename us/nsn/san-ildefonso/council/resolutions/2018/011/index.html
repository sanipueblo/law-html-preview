                <p>
                  <preamble>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the __6th day of June, 2018, the following Resolution was adopted:</preamble>
                </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso ("Pueblo") is a sovereign and self-governing Tribe, recognized as such by the United States of America; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the sovereign authority of the Pueblo is vested in its Council and Governor; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, San Ildefonso Services, LLC, ("SIS LLC") is chartered under tribal law as a single member limited liability company wholly owned by the Pueblo, and the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Governor and Council currently serve as the Member's Representatives; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo owned and operated two businesses within the Pueblo's lands commonly referred to as the Totavi and White Rock Phillips 66 Convenience Stores and Gas Stations ("C-Stores"); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council transferred the ownership and operation of the C-Stores to "SIS LLC, effective July 1, 2017; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS LLC assumed all liabilities, including contracts and accounts, of the C-Stores accrued after July 1, 2017, and SIS LLC is responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes related to the operation of or otherwise imposed on the C-Stores; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS LLC assumed full responsibility for insuring, maintaining, and repairing the C-Stores; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS LLC assumed all C-Stores employees and responsible for payroll, benefits, and related human resources matters for employees of the C-Stores; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, since the July 1, 2017 acquisition of the C-Stores, SIS LLC has endeavored to enhance the operations and profitability of the C-Stores but operational and procurement costs have made this extremely difficult; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on May 21, 2018, SIS LLC presented the C-Stores' financial concerns, along with supporting financial information, to the Council and requested that the Pueblo provide a subsidy of $0.06 for every gallon of gasoline sold to allow SIS LLC to adequately compete in the local C-Store market; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council has determined it is in the Pueblo's best interest to support SIS LLC and its operation of the C-Stores and provide a subsidy of $0.06 for every gallon of gasoline sold, and has identified that such subsidy could be paid from revenues generated by the Pueblo's $0.17 per gallon fuel tax, and such subsidy shall be made pursuant to specific terms contained herein.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled, "ACT APPROVING TAX SUBSIDY TO SAN ILDEFONSO SERVICES, LLC."</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(a)</span> The Council hereby approves and authorizes the provision of a subsidy to SIS LLC of $0.06 for every gallon of gasoline sold by the C-Stores.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> Such subsidy shall be paid by the Pueblo from revenues received by the Pueblo from $0.17 per gallon fuel tax paid by the C-Stores.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(c)</span> The subsidy shall be used by SIS as much as possible to reduce costs to increase customer traffic to the C-Stores.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(d)</span> The subsidy shall begin within thirty (30) days of the effective date of this Act and shall expire one (1) year from the effective date of this Act.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(e)</span> SIS LLC shall provide monthly financial fuel reports, and such other requested information or documents, to the Governor to support the continuation of said subsidy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(f)</span> The Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council authorizes the Pueblo Governor to initiate the subsidy and develop and execute any documents that may be necessary to support the provision of said subsidy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num">(g)</span> The Governor is authorized to take such actions as deemed necessary to carry out the intent and direction of this Act.</p>
                <p>CERTIFICATION</p>
                <p>The foregoing resolution was duly voted upon by the Council on June 6, 2018, at a meeting with a vote of 8 in favor, 2 opposed, 0 abstaining and 0 absent (Governor presiding and not voting) pursuant to the authority vested in the Council by the Agreement of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso.</p>

                <p>The Council hereby finds and declares that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(a)">(a)</span> San Ildefonso Services, LLC, ("SIS LLC") is chartered under tribal law as a single member limited liability company wholly owned by the Pueblo, and the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Governor and Council currently serve as the Member's Representatives.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(b)">(b)</span> The Pueblo owned and operated two businesses within the Pueblo's lands commonly referred to as the Totavi and White Rock Phillips 66 Convenience Stores and Gas Stations ("C-Stores").</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(c)">(c)</span> The Council transferred the ownership and operation of the C-Stores to "SIS LLC, effective July 1, 2017.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(d)">(d)</span> SIS LLC assumed all liabilities, including contracts and accounts, of the C-Stores accrued after July 1, 2017, and SIS LLC is responsible for the payment of any applicable taxes related to the operation of or otherwise imposed on the C-Stores.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(e)">(e)</span> SIS LLC assumed full responsibility for insuring, maintaining, and repairing the C-Stores.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(f)">(f)</span> SIS LLC assumed all C-Stores employees and responsible for payroll, benefits, and related human resources matters for employees of the C-Stores.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(g)">(g)</span> Since the July 1, 2017 acquisition of the C-Stores, SIS LLC has endeavored to enhance the operations and profitability of the C-Stores but operational and procurement costs have made this extremely difficult. On May 21, 2018, SIS LLC presented the C-Stores' financial concerns along with supporting financial information, to the Council and formally requested that the Pueblo provide a subsidy of $0.06  for every gallon sold to allow SIS LLC to adequately compete in the local market.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(h)">(h)</span> The Council has determined it is in the Pueblo's best interest to support SIS LLC and its operation of the C-Stores and provide a subsidy of $0.06 for every gallon sold, and has identified that such subsidy could be paid from revenues generated by the Pueblo's $0.17 per gallon fuel tax, and such subsidy shall be made pursuant to specific terms contained herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(i)">(i)</span> The Council has determined that the Pueblo Governor may execute such subsidy pursuant to certain essential terms contained herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law1.3(j)">(j)</span> The Council finds the need to approve the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Tax Subsidy to San Ildefonso Services, LLC.</p>
