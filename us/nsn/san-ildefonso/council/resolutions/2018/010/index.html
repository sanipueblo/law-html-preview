                <p>WHEREAS, the Roads Settlement Agreement calls for the Pueblo to take certain legislative actions to implement the terms of the Roads Settlement Agreement including authorizing the Governor of the Pueblo to grant temporary permits for roads and/or access to Private Lands located within the boundaries of Pueblo Lands.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled, "INTERIM ROAD ACCESS AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2018."</p>
