                  <preamble>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 8th day of December, 2022, the following law was adopted:</preamble>
                </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo of San Ildefonso (Pueblo) is a sovereign and self-governing Nation, duly recognized by the United States of America, with the authority to govern its people, lands, and other resources; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo has experienced an increasing number of abandoned cars and other vehicles on Pueblo Lands; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, abandoned vehicles create an unsafe environment by fostering rodent infestation, chemical contamination, as well as creating a safety hazard for children and an eyesore within the community; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council has determined that eliminating abandoned vehicles from Pueblo Lands in a fair manner with proper safeguards provided to vehicle owners is in the best interest of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled "First Amendment to the Abandoned Vehicle Act of 2018."</p>
