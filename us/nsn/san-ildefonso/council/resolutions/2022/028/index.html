                <p>WHEREAS, the sovereign authority of the Pueblo is vested in its Council and Governor; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo previously enacted a law titled "Act to Transfer Ownership and Operation of C-Stores to San Ildefonso Services, LLC"; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo and San Ildefonso Services, LLC entered into the Business Lease (the "Business Lease") for the White Rock Gas Station and Convenience Store dated May 9, 2018, and the term of such lease began on July 1, 2017; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the transfer of ownership and operation of the Totavi and White Rock C-Stores became effective on July 1, 2017; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on or about March 22, 2019, the Pueblo and San Ildefonso Services, LLC amended the Business Lease to correct the acreage of the leased premises and to update the date of the Surveyor's Certificate; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Business Lease and its accompanying amendment were both approved by the Superintendent, Northern Pueblo Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), on March 27, 2019, which is attached hereto as Attachment A; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on or around November 25, 2020, the Parties further amended the Business Lease (the "Second Amended Lease") whereby SIS LLC secured a loan for purposes of making upgrades and other improvements to the White Rock Gas Station and Convenience Store, and the Business Lease was extended for an additional five years through September 30, 2027, see Council Resolution No. SI-R20-023 and the Second Amended Lease attached hereto as Attachment B; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, there is no record that the Second Amended Lease was recorded with the BIA; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo and San Ildefonso desire to further amend the Business Lease to expand the land included in the leased area as described in the proposed Third Amended Lease which is attached hereto as Attachment C (the "Third Amended Lease"); and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Business Lease, as amended, prohibits subleases, assignments, management agreements, or transfers of the Business Lease or any rights to or interest in the Business Lease, without the written approval of the Pueblo, the Secretary and sureties, if any; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo and San Ildefonso Services, LLC desire to amend Paragraph K, Sublease, Assignment, Management Agreement, Transfer of the Business Lease, as amended, to only require approval by the Pueblo and to remove approval of the Secretary and sureties, if any; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo and San Ildefonso Services, LLC desire to diversify the services provided by the business on the property including all lawful business uses; and</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, for purposes of recording this Amendment with BIA, the changes agreed upon by the Pueblo and San Ildefonso Services, LLC that are reflected in the Second Amendment are hereby incorporated into this Amendment.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled, "APPROVING AND AUTHORIZING THE THIRD AMENDED BUSINESS LEASE WITH SAN ILDEFONSO SERVICES, LLC FOR THE WHITE ROCK GAS STATION AND CONVENIENCE STORE."</p>
                <p>BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, that the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council hereby approves and</p>
                <p>adopts this resolution in accordance with the requirements of the amended Agreement, according to Council procedures, and authorizes and directs the Governor, or his designee, to take such actions as deemed necessary to carry out the intent of this resolution.</p>
