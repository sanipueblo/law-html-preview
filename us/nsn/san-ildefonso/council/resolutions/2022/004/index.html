                <p>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 5th day of May, 2022, the following law was adopted:</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso (Pueblo) has a long-standing custom and common law that prohibits non-members of the Pueblo from acquiring land or interests in land within the Pueblo; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo is experiencing increasing pressures on land and land uses and has identified the need to codify the custom prohibiting the transfers of land and interests in land to non-members of the Pueblo; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo has also identified the need to clarify the law requiring non-members of the Pueblo who seek to reside within the Pueblo with a member of the Pueblo to register and to seek permission to become a resident; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo has also identified the need to protect those resident non-members of the Pueblo who have lived in the Pueblo and who have respected the customs and laws of the Pueblo for at least the past five years to remain resident of the Pueblo without the need to register and seek permission to remain; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo has identified the need to enact a law to allow a resident widow or widower of a member of the Pueblo to continue their residency within the Pueblo subject to approval by the Governor.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled "LAND INTEREST PROHIBITIONS AND RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR NON-TRIBAL MEMBERS ACT."</p>

                <p>The purpose of this Act is to codify the Pueblo's custom and common-law that prohibits non-members from acquiring land or interests in land within the Pueblo and clarify the requirements for non-members wishing to reside within the Pueblo.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.3(a)">(a)</span> the Pueblo de San Ildefonso (Pueblo) has a long-standing custom and common law that prohibits non-members of the Pueblo from acquiring land or interests in land within the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.3(b)">(b)</span> the Pueblo is experiencing increasing pressures on land and land uses and has identified the need to codify the custom prohibiting the transfers of land and interests in land to non-</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.3(c)">(c)</span> the Pueblo has also identified the need to clarify the law requiring non-members of the Pueblo who seek to reside within the Pueblo with a member of the Pueblo to register and to seek permission to become a resident.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.3(d)">(d)</span> the Pueblo has also identified the need to protect those resident non-members of the Pueblo who have lived in the Pueblo and who have respected the customs and laws of the Pueblo for at least the past five years to remain resident of the Pueblo without the need to register and seek permission to remain.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="attachments/law/1.3(e)">(e)</span> the Pueblo has identified the need to enact a law to allow a resident widow or widower of a member of the Pueblo to continue their residency within the Pueblo subject to approval by the Governor.</p>
