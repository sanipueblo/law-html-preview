                <p>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 13th day of December, 2024, the following law was adopted:</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso is vested with the authority to make and pass laws by the governing Agreement of the Pueblo de San Ildefonso; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council has become aware of certain inconsistencies between the governing Agreement adopted in 2011, and laws enacted prior to 2011 that address Housing and Housing-related matters, including the 2007 "Ordinance Concerning Mortgages, Foreclosures, and Evictions"; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council now deems it necessary and proper to reconcile the inconsistencies by amending and repealing certain provisions of law and enacting new law.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, THAT the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled "LEASING AND MORTGAGE ACT OF 2024."</p>
