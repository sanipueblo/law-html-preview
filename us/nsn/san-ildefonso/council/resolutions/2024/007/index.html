                <p>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 15th day of May, 2024, the following resolution was adopted:</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, San Ildefonso Services, LLC (SIS) is wholly owned by a single member, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso (the "Pueblo"), for the benefit of the Pueblo and its members; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, San Ildefonso Services, LLC is a Manager-Managed LLC, which is currently operated by a four-member Board; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, San Ildefonso Services, LLC is authorized by its Articles of Organization to engage in business ventures, acquire, manage, and operate buildings, personal property, and real property, and to take any action incidental, necessary, or convenient to affect any or all of the purposes for which it is organized; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, economic development and job creation are priorities of the Pueblo; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, SIS plans to apply for GRID Alternatives' Tribal Solar Accelerator Fund ("TSAF Grant") for $200,000.00 for tribal facility solar project to expand solar job opportunities in tribal communities; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, assistance from SIS, in 2023, the Pueblo was awarded a formula grant in the amount of $144,178.00 from DOE through the Grid Deployment Office ("DOE Grant") funded by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law whose description includes "enhancing the resilience of the electric grid to States and Indian Tribes" and for which such funds can be contributed to the TSAF Grant tribal facility solar project; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the 2024-2026 formula grants from this same source each total in excess of $200,000.00 indicating the Pueblo will receive additional funds from this source; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the 2023 DOE Grant requires 15% match funding or in-kind funds totaling $21,626.70, which will be satisfied by use of State of New Mexico matching grant funds through the New Mexico Indian Affairs Department ("IAD"); and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo supports SIS' proposed plan for the TSAF Grant funding is to install a 50kW solar covered carport structure for the Tribal Administrative building parking lot employing tribal members from the Pueblo as the labor force who will be trained and hired for the project; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, this size system would cover the electric utility bill from the Tribal Administrative building on the Pueblo's tribal lands offsetting approximately $1,000/month in Jemez Mountain Electric Coop charges and fees; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the cost of this project is approximately $350,000 and requires funding from the Pueblo's DOE Grant funds, including the IAD's match funds; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the project, if awarded could be completed within one year after being awarded the TSAF Grant funding; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the SIS Manager with the support of the SIS Member's Representatives unanimously approved a motion to proceed with the above options for Tribal Council's consideration and support of submitting an application to the TSAF at a special Member's Representatives meeting held on May1, 2024; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Tribal Council believes it is in the best interest of the Pueblo for SIS to apply for the TSAF Grant and to contribute DOE Grant funds and IAD match funding.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED, that the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled "ACT SUPPORTING SAN ILDEFONSO SERVICES' APPLICATION TO GRID ALTERNATIVES TRIBAL SOLAR ACCELERATOR FUND FOR TRIBAL FACILTY SOLAR PROJECT FUNDING."</p>
