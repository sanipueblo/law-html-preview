                <p>At a duly called meeting of the Council of San Ildefonso Pueblo on the 15th day of December, 2023, the following Resolution was adopted:</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo previously enacted a law titled "Act to Transfer Ownership and Operation of C-Stores to San Ildefonso Services, LLC"; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo and San Ildefonso Services, LLC entered into the Business Lease (the "Business Lease") for the White Rock Gas Station and Convenience Store dated May 9, 2018, and the term of such lease began on July 1, 2017; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the transfer of ownership and operation of the Totavi and White Rock C-Stores became effective on July 1, 2017; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on or about March 22, 2019, the Pueblo and San Ildefonso Services, LLC amended the Business Lease to correct the acreage of the leased premises and to update the date of the Surveyor's Certificate; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Business Lease and its accompanying amendment were both approved by the Superintendent, Northern Pueblo Agency, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), on March 27, 2019, a copy of which is attached hereto as Attachment A; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, on or around November 25, 2020, the Council and SIS further amended the Business Lease (the "Second Amended Business Lease") by Council Resolution No. SI-R20-023, whereby SIS LLC secured a USDA loan for purposes of making upgrades and other improvements to the White Rock Gas Station and Convenience Store, and the lease was extended for an additional five years through September 30, 2027; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, a fully executed copy of the Second Amended Business Lease cannot be found and there is no record that it was recorded with the Bureau of Indian Affairs ("BIA") for review and approval; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council and SIS executed and approved a Third Amended Business Lease for the White Rock Gas Station and Convenience Store by Council Resolution No. SI-R22-028, increasing the acreage of the leased area and removing Secretarial and sureties approval for subleases, assignments, management, agreements, or transfers of the Business Lease, and SIS submitted it to BIA for review and approval; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, upon submission of the Third Amended Business Lease to BIA, BIA informed SIS that it could not approve it without receiving and approving the Second Amended Business Lease for the White Rock Gas Station, which cannot be back dated and for which a Tribal Council resolution must accompany the submission to BIA; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, to satisfy BIA's review and approval process, and in the absence of the Second Amended Business Lease approved by SI-R20-023, Council wishes to rescind Council Resolutions No. SI-R20-023 and No. SI-R22-028, and to approve this Revised Second Amended Business Lease for the White Rock Gas Station (the "Revised Second Amended Business Lease") which incorporates and combines the terms initially approved by Council in SI-R20-23 and SI-R22-028; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, based on its previous decisions, the Council still desires to amend the Business Lease for the White Rock Gas Station and Convenience Store to extend the term to September 30, 2027; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, based on its previous decisions, the Council still desires to further amend the Business Lease to expand the acres included in the leased area as described in the Revised Second Amended Business Lease which is attached hereto as Attachment B; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Business Lease, as amended, prohibits subleases, assignments, management agreements, or transfers of the Business Lease or any rights to or interest in the Business Lease, without the written approval of the Pueblo, the Secretary and sureties, if any; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, based on its previous decisions, the Council still desires to amend Paragraph K, Sublease, Assignment, Management Agreement, Transfer of the Business Lease, as amended, to only require approval by the Pueblo and to remove approval of the Secretary and sureties, if any; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, based on its previous decisions, the Council still desires San Ildefonso Services, LLC (SIS) to diversify the services provided by the business on the property including all lawful business uses as described in the Revised Second Amended Business Lease.</p>
                <p>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT, the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled the "Act Authorizing the Revised Second Amended Business Lease with San Ildefonso Services, LLC for the White Rock Gas Station and Convenience Store"; and</p>
                <p>BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, that the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council hereby approves and adopts this Resolution in accordance with the requirements of the Revised Second Amended Business Lease, according to published Council procedures, and authorizes and directs the Governor, or his designee, to take such actions as deemed necessary to carry out the intent of this Resolution.</p>
