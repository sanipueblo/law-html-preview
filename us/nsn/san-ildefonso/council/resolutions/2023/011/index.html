                </p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso ("Pueblo") is a sovereign and self-governing Tribe, recognized as such by the United States of America; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the sovereign authority of the Pueblo is vested in its Council and Governor; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo's Election Law governs the scope and process for tribal elections; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Election Commission ("Election Commission") has determined a need to establish absentee voting in situations where students and active military personnel will be out of state at the time of a tribal election, and for homebound tribal elders who will not be able to physically appear at the tribal polling place; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Election Commission has proposed changes to the Election Law to allow for absentee voting, including changes to some deadlines to accommodate timely issuance and return of absentee ballots, as shown on Attachment A hereto; and,</p>
                <p>WHEREAS, the Council has reviewed the proposed changes to the Election Law and determines it is in the best interest of the Pueblo to authorize amendment of the Election Law to allow for absentee voting in limited situations.</p>
                <p><strong>NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT,</strong> the Council hereby enacts the attached law entitled the "Act Amending the Election Law to Allow Absentee Voting"; and,</p>
                <p>BE IT FINALLY RESOLVED, that the Pueblo de San Ildefonso Council hereby authorizes and directs the Election Commisison to take such actions as deemed necessary to carry out the intent of this Resolution.</p>
