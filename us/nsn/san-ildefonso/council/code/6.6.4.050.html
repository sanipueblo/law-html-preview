                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(b)</span> The Account(s) shall be invested with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the investment of a fund of like character and with like aims.</p>

                <p class="quote">INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT POLICY</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">1.</span> Preservation of Capital – Consistent with their respective investment styles and philosophies, investment managers should make reasonable efforts to preserve capital, understanding that losses may occur.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">2.</span> Risk Aversion – Understanding that risk is present in all types of securities and investment styles, the Council recognizes that some risk is necessary to produce long-term investment results that are sufficient to meet the Investment Account(s)'s objectives.  However, the investment managers are to make reasonable efforts to control risk, and will be evaluated regularly to ensure that the risk assumed is commensurate with the given investment style and objectives.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">3.</span> Adherence to Investment Discipline – Investment managers will be expected to adhere to the investment management styles for which they were hired.  Managers will be evaluated regularly for adherence to investment discipline.</p>
                <p class="quote">INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES</p>
                <p class="quote">In order to meet its needs, the investment strategy of the Pueblo is to emphasize total return; that is, the aggregate return from capital appreciation and dividend and interest income.</p>
                <p class="quote">SPECIFIC INVESTMENT GOALS</p>
                <p class="quote">Over the investment horizon established in this Statement, it is the goal of the aggregate Investment Account(s) assets to exceed an absolute annualized, return of 5%, over a market cycle of 5 years unless the Tribe hires an additional investment manager(s) with a different investment style of investments.</p>
                <p class="quote">The investment goal above is the objective of the aggregate Investment Account(s), and is not meant to be imposed on each investment account (if more than one account is used).  The goal of the investment manager, over the investment horizon, shall be to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">1.</span> Meet or exceed the market index, or blended market index, selected and agreed upon by the Investment Committee that most closely corresponds to the style of the investment manager.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">2.</span> Display an overall level of risk in the portfolio which is consistent with the risk associated with the benchmark specified above.  Risk will be measured by the standard deviation of quarterly returns.</p>
                <p class="quote">Specific investment goals and constraints for each investment manager, if any, shall be incorporated as part of this Statement of Investment Policy.  The manager shall receive a written statement outlining his/her specific goals as they differ from those objectives of the entire Investment Account.</p>
                <p class="quote">DEFINITION OF RISK</p>
                <p class="quote">The Council realizes that there are many ways to define risk.  The Council believes that any person or organization involved in the process of managing the Pueblo's assets understands how the Pueblo defines risk so that the assets are managed in a manner consistent with the Investment Account(s)'s objectives and investment strategy as defined in this statement of investment policy.  The Council defines risk as:</p>
                <p class="quote">The probability of not meeting the Investment Account(s)'s objectives.</p>
                <p class="quote">LIQUIDITY</p>
                <p class="quote">To minimize the possibility of a loss caused by the need to liquidate securities<em>, </em>the Governor will periodically provide investment managers with an estimate of expected net cash flow.  The Governor will notify the investment manager in a timely manner, to allow sufficient time for the money manager to build up necessary liquid reserves.    The Governor will inform the Council through the Lt. Governor, of the cash flow need estimate provided to the Investment Manager(s).</p>
                <p class="quote">To maintain the ability to deal with unplanned cash requirements that might arise, the Council prefers that a minimum of 1% of Investment Account(s) assets shall be maintained in cash of cash equivalents, including money market funds or short-term U.S. Treasury bills.</p>
                <p class="quote">MARKETABILITY OF ASSETS</p>
                <p class="quote">The Council requires that all  Investment Account(s) assets be invested in liquid securities, defined as securities that can be transacted quickly and efficiently for the Investment Account(s), with minimal impact on market price.</p>
                <p class="quote">INVESTMENT GUIDELINES</p>
