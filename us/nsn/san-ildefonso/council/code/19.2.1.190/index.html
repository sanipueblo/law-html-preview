                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> It shall be unlawful for any person to own any animal over the age of four (4) months unless such animal is appropriately vaccinated with a vaccine licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture as recommended in the current "Compendium of Animal Rabies Control," prepared by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, Inc.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> The Owner of an animal shall furnish the current certificate of vaccination upon request by the Animal Control Officer.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> A suitable and distinctive collar tag and certificate of rabies vaccination certifying that the animal in question has been vaccinated shall be issued to the Owner at the time of vaccination.  The collar tag shall be securely affixed to the animal's collar, as appropriate, and shall be worn at all times when the animal is not confined within the Owner's or custodian's dwelling unit.  An Owner of a horse may keep a horse's tag in the Owner's residence.  The Owner must present the tag to the Animal Control Officer upon request.  Proof of rabies inoculation or vaccination in the form of a written certificate must be produced when requested.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> A certificate of rabies vaccination issued under this Section shall comply with Section 10.9(C)(2) of this Act.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> <span class="level-heading">Declaration of Rabies Emergency.</span> When sufficient evidence exists to believe that a rabid or potentially rabid animal is at-large within Pueblo Lands, the Animal Control Officer may undertake any actions necessary to immediately contain and prevent the spread of rabies.  This will require the immediate cooperation of other Pueblo officials to abate the emergency situation.  The Animal Control Office may issue an emergency rule (which shall become effective upon passage) which may require owners and custodians of animals to keep their animals confined upon their premises unless under leash and under the control of the Owner or custodian so as not to subject their animals to contact with the rabid animal.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(e)(4)">(4)</span> The Owner of any animal reported to have exposed a person or other animal to a rabid or suspected rabid animal shall give the Animal Control Officer or Public Health Official prompt access to the animal at any time as may be necessary for verification of quarantine or as may be required to prevent the spread of rabies and thereby safeguard human life.  Upon order by the Animal Control Officer, the Owner shall immediately relinquish such animal to the Officer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(e)(5)">(5)</span> It shall be unlawful for any person to evade or elude the Animal Control Officer or to dispose of, conceal, harbor, or remove from Pueblo Lands any animal to keep the animal from being quarantined, euthanized, or confined in accordance with this Act.</p>

Such quarantines shall meet the criteria set forth by the Animal Control Officer in accordance with the current guidelines in the "Compendium of Animal Rabies Control."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> Strict Isolation or absolute quarantine means the restriction of contact between exposed subjects and other animals and/or humans for a period of time not longer than the longest usual incubation of the disease.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)(3)">(3)</span> Modified quarantine means a selective, partial limitation of freedom of movement and contact between exposed and nonexposed humans and/or animals as deemed appropriate to prevent transmission of the disease.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(h)(1)(A)">(A)</span> If the animal is ordered impounded or to be contained at a veterinary facility, the Owner shall be responsible for all impoundment or containment fees, whether or not the animal is determined to be rabid.</p>
