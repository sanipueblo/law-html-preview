                <p>The Council hereby finds and declares that the current process for members of the Pueblo to obtain ownership of a home through the Northern Pueblo Housing Authority ("NPHA") includes the following:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(b)">(b)</span> The Pueblo enters into a lease (the "NPHA Lease") with the Northern Pueblos Housing Authority, a federally recognized Tribally Designated Housing Entity ("NPHA") holding authorization from the Pueblos of Picuris, San Ildefonso and Tesuque tribes to obtain and manage Indian Housing Block Grant Program ("IHBG") funding from HUD covering the parcel of land on the Pueblo's reservation where the house is to be located (the "Subject Parcel"), recognizing that, at times, the NPHA lease may cover several parcels (a "master lease");</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(c)">(c)</span> Since the Subject Parcel is on the Pueblo's reservation, which is held in trust for the Pueblo by the US Government, the Subject Parcel is subject to federal law;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/san-ildefonso/council/code/15.2.1.030#(e)">(e)</span> Using IHBG funding or other funds, the NPHA builds a house on the Subject Parcel covered by the NPHA Lease;</p>
