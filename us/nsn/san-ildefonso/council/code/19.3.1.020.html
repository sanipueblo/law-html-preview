                  <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">The Pueblo de San Ildefonso is a sovereign self-governing Nation and recognized as such by the United States of America.  The Pueblo Tribal Council is the governing body and has legislative and other responsibilities for the Pueblo in its exercise of its inherent sovereign powers.  A primary objective of the Tribal Council is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.</p>
                <p class="quote">This Policy is designed to acquaint you with the Pueblo and provide you with information about working conditions, employee benefits, and some of the policies affecting your employment.  It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and outlines the programs developed by the Pueblo to benefit employees.  It is your responsibility to read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Policy.</p>
                <p class="quote">One of our objectives is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.</p>
                <p class="quote">No Personnel Policy can anticipate every circumstance or question.  Over time, the need may arise and the Pueblo reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies as the Tribal Council deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. Employees will be notified appropriately of such changes.</p>
                <p class="quote">These policies and procedures shall apply to all employees of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="quote">

                  <strong>101. Nature of Employment</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">Employment with the Pueblo is "at-will" so that employment is voluntarily entered into by the employee and the employee is free to resign at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the Pueblo is free to terminate the employment at any time, with or without cause.  Employees may be given the right to pursue grievance procedures.</p>
                <p class="quote">This Policy is not a contract. The policies set forth are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations, express or implied, to remain employed by the Pueblo. Nor does it guarantee any fixed terms or conditions of employment. Nothing in any policy or work rule of the Pueblo shall alter the at-will employment relationship between the Pueblo and its employees.</p>
                <p class="quote">This Policy is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of employment with the Pueblo. However, this Policy cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about employment.

                  <strong>102. Equal Employment Opportunity</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Pueblo will be based on performance, job qualifications, and experience. The Pueblo does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. However, the Pueblo will give preference in employment to qualified American Indians and Pueblo Tribal members as described by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and other applicable laws.</p>
                <p class="quote">This policy applies to all employment practices, including recruiting, hiring, evaluation, promotion, transfer, discipline and termination, as well as all forms of employee compensation. All of the Pueblo's policies will be interpreted to permit and promote reasonable accommodation of the disabilities and religious beliefs and practices of otherwise qualified employees and applicants, except where such accommodation causes undue hardship to the Pueblo. The extent of an obligation is determined by the Pueblo of San Ildefonso's needs, financial costs and expense, in conformity with applicable law.</p>
                <p class="quote">Every employee is expected to conform to this policy, to accomplish work in a professional and businesslike manner, and to be courteous to all other employees, contractors, business associates, customers, guests, and visitors at all times. Discrimination against or harassment of any employee or other person because of race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry or disability is strictly prohibited.</p>

                  <strong>103. Business Ethics and Conduct</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">The successful operation and reputation of the Pueblo is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Employees owe a duty to the Pueblo, its community members and the Tribal Council to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a positive and professional manner so as to promote the best interests of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="quote">The Pueblo will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all applicable laws and regulations and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.</p>
                <p class="quote">In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide employees with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter will be referred to the Tribal Administrator who will make a final determination on the issue. Conduct that interferes with operations, discredits, or is offensive the Pueblo, the public, or fellow employees will not be tolerated.</p>

                  <strong>104. Conflicts of Interest</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. Employees are expected, at all times, to act in the best interest of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="quote">Transactions with outside firms<sup>-</sup> must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the Governor of the Pueblo. Business dealings with outside firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms or employees. Unusual gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks, and other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit the employer, the employee, or both. Plans that could be interpreted to involve unusual gain require specific approval from the Tribal Council.</p>
                <p class="quote">An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of the Pueblo's business dealings.</p>
                <p class="quote">However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to the Tribal Administrator the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.</p>
                <p class="quote">Personal gain may occur not only in cases where an employee or relative has a significant ownership in a firm with which the Pueblo does business, but also when an employee or relative receives special consideration or unusual gain as a result of any transaction or business dealing.</p>
                <p class="quote">
                  <strong>105. Outside Employment</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">Unless a conflict of interest is created, an employee may hold a job with another organization as long as that employee, first, obtains the written acknowledgment from their Director and, second, continues to satisfactorily perform their job responsibilities with the Pueblo. The second job cannot interfere with the position held with the Pueblo of San Ildefonso.   All employees will be judged by the same performance standards and will be subject to the Pueblo's scheduling demands, regardless of any existing outside work requirements.</p>
                <p class="quote">If the Pueblo determines that an employee's outside work interferes with performance or the ability to meet the requirements of the Pueblo, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside employment as a condition of remaining employed by the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="quote">Outside employment will present a conflict of interest if it has an adverse impact on the Pueblo or otherwise is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 104 Conflicts of Interest.</p>

                  <strong>106. Dress Code</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">Dress, grooming, and personal cleanliness standards contribute to the morale of all employees and affect the business image the Pueblo presents to community members and visitors. Attire should be clean, tasteful, non-offensive and non-revealing.</p>
                <p class="quote">During business hours, employees are expected to present a clean and neat appearance and to dress according to the requirements of their positions. Employees who appear for work inappropriately dressed will be sent home and directed to return to work in proper attire. Under such circumstances, employees will not be compensated for the time away from work.</p>
                <p class="quote">Consult your Director or supervisor if you have questions as to what constitutes appropriate attire.</p>

                <p class="quote">Job vacancies will first be posted on the employee bulletin board and within the community of the Pueblo. Announcements may be sent to other recruiting sources and publications as applicable. It is within the sole discretion of the Pueblo to fill a vacancy with an existing employee or hire a new employee from outside of the Pueblo. Each job posting notice will include the job title, department, location, job summary, essential duties, qualifications, and the closing date for receipt of applications.</p>
                <p class="quote">To be eligible to apply for a posted job, employees must have performed competently for at least ninety (90) calendar days in their current position. Employees who have not completed any corrective action issued in connection with a written warning, or who are on probation or suspension, are not eligible to apply for posted jobs. When an applicant is considered for a position, the hiring supervisor or Director will contact the applicant's Director to verify performance, skills, and attendance.</p>
                <p class="quote">Upon transfer to another program, an employee, at the discretion of the Pueblo, may be compensated for 50% of any accrued annual leave to be paid by the program from which the employee is transferring. The remaining accrued annual leave and all sick leaves shall be carried over to the new program. This policy is meant to prevent the new program from bearing the burden of carrying and covering the full amount of accrued annual leave for a transferred employee.</p>

Background investigations will be conducted on business managers for businesses operated by the Pueblo and not its corporation, financial managers, controller and assistant controller.  These financial positions do not require an FBI Criminal History Records Search.</p>
                <p class="quote">It is the policy of the Pueblo that background investigations, and reinvestigations every five years, shall be conducted on those individuals in positions covered by Public Law 101-630, Indian Child Protection and Family Violence Prevention Act for the protection of children and of the elderly.  A favorable background investigation meeting the minimum standards of inquiries identified in federal regulations is a condition of employment for individuals working with, having regular contact with or having control over children and the elderly.</p>
                <p class="quote">Covered programs include but are not limited to the following:   (1) All Health and Human Services programs including Community Health Representative Program, Diabetes Program;, Health Coalition,  Senior Citizens Center, and the Indian Child Welfare Act Program; and (2) all Education programs including the Language Program, Recreation and Youth, the Parks and Wildlife Program and (3) the Tribal Courts.

The Pueblo may appoint one additional Suitability Official. The Suitability determination process protects the interests of the Pueblo and the rights of applicants and employees. The Suitability Determination Process requires uniform evaluation to ensure fair and consistent judgment.</p>
                <p class="quote">The Suitability Official is the designated representative for the Pueblo who directs proper background investigations and suitability determinations.  The Suitability Official must be qualified for the position and the responsibilities of his/her office and must have a favorable background investigation and suitability determination.

All precautions shall be taken to guarantee confidentiality.</p>

A subordinate should not make a suitability determination for his/her immediate supervisor.</p>

This determination is based on considerations of whether the conduct of the person indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on (1) the performance of the person in the position applied for or employed in; (2) the accomplishment of the duties and responsibilities of others in the Pueblo; or (3) the ability of the Pueblo to fully and effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Whether the conduct in question indicates a potential for inadequate or reduced accomplishment of specific duties; and (2) whether the conduct indicates any immediate or long-term risk for abuse of trust in carrying out the responsibilities of the position.

                <p class="quote">The Suitability Official shall consider the following additional factors to the extent that these factors are deemed pertinent to the individual case:</p>

The employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working relationships.</p>
                <p class="quote">In case of actual or potential problems between or among relatives who work in the same area, the Pueblo may monitor the problem and may take prompt action to attempt to resolve the problem. This may include reassignment or, if necessary because no resolution is possible, one or both employees may be required to resign or be terminated.</p>
                <p class="quote">A "relative" as used in this Policy is any person who is related by blood or marriage in the immediate family or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage.

                <p class="quote"><strong>Probationary: </strong>Employees whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position with the Pueblo is appropriate. Employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period of ninety (90) calendar days will be notified of their new employment classification. The probationary period may be extended to continue assessment of the employee's performance. The probationary period will be extended by the same amount of days that have been authorized and taken as leave during the probationary period as described in Section 303. The employee shall be terminated if job performance during the probationary period is not satisfactory. Probationary employees accrue annual and sick leave from the date of hire, however, use of such leave by probationary employees during the probationary period is not authorized except in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the immediate supervisor and the Tribal Administrator.</p>
                <p class="quote"><strong>Temporary: </strong>Employees who are hired as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project or as an emergency hire. Employment assignments in this category are of a limited duration (90-Day or unless a waiver granted for the Governor for an extension). Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change. Temporary employees are ineligible for the Pueblo's benefits, unless otherwise expressly provided.</p>

The Pueblo de San Ildefonso uses this period to evaluate employees' capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. All new, transferred and rehired employees work on a probationary basis for the first ninety (90) calendar days after their date of hire or transfer.</p>
                <p class="quote">A probationary employee may be terminated or transferred at will during the probationary period when his or her abilities or performance are judged insufficient by the immediate supervisor.

                <p class="quote">All employees, and everyone on Pueblo property, should be treated with courtesy and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, "horseplay," or other conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of the Pueblo without proper authorization.</p>
                <p class="quote">Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a client, or a member of the public at any time, including off-duty periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all acts of harassment, including harassment that is based on an individual's sex, race, age, or any characteristic protected by federal law.</p>
                <p class="quote">All threats of, or actual, violence, both direct and indirect, must be reported as soon as possible to your immediate Director or any other member of management. This includes threats by employees, as well as threats by community members, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible.</p>
                <p class="quote">The Pueblo will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats and/or actual violence and suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report will be protected as much as is practical. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity of its investigation, the Pueblo may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending investigation.</p>
                <p class="quote">Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of, or actual violence or other conduct that is in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action, including termination of employment.</p>
                <p class="quote">The Pueblo encourages employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the attention of their Directors or the Human Resources Department. If the matter cannot be resolved, then the Director and employee together should bring the matter to the attention of the Tribal Administrator. Thereafter, within the discretion of the Tribal Administrator, the matter may be brought to the attention of the Governor. The Pueblo is eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes, and will not discipline employees for raising such concerns.</p>

                <p class="quote">The Pueblo has a strong commitment to the health, safety, and welfare of its employees, their families, and its constituents. Widely available statistics and  information establish that the incidence of drug and alcohol abuse is increasing and that the effect is devastating to lives, business, and the community at large. The Pueblo is concerned that due to the potential for</p>

Our commitment to maintaining a safe and secure workplace requires a clear policy and supportive programs relating to the detection, treatment, and prevention of substance</p>

It is the policy of the Pueblo to maintain a workplace free from alcohol and other drug abuse and its effects.

                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">2.</span> It is the policy of the Pueblo that employees who engage in the sale, use, possession, or transfer of illegal drugs or controlled substances, or buy or sell such substances, or use alcohol during work hours, or abuse prescribed drugs, will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. (However, nothing in this policy precludes the appropriate use of legally prescribed medications).</p>

The applicant's signature on the employment application is an agreement by that applicant to submit to pre-employment drug testing.

After successful completion of all requirements of this section, employees will again be subject to the testing program applicable to all employees. Appropriate Pueblo representatives shall determine whether an employee referred for illegal drug use or controlled substance abuse treatment or counseling should be reassigned to another position.

The aggrieved employee and Supervisor shall promptly meet to discuss and attempt to resolve the matter.
