                  <strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">The Pueblo de San Ildefonso is a sovereign self-governing Nation and recognized as such by the United States of America.  The Pueblo Tribal Council is the governing body and has legislative and other responsibilities for the Pueblo in its exercise of its inherent sovereign powers.  A primary objective of the Tribal Council is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.</p>
                <p class="quote">This Policy is designed to acquaint you with the Pueblo and provide you with information about working conditions, employee benefits, and some of the policies affecting your employment.  It describes many of your responsibilities as an employee and outlines the programs developed by the Pueblo to benefit employees.  It is your responsibility to read, understand, and comply with all provisions of the Policy.</p>
                <p class="quote">One of our objectives is to provide a work environment that is conducive to both personal and professional growth.</p>
                <p class="quote">No Personnel Policy can anticipate every circumstance or question.  Over time, the need may arise and the Pueblo reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any policies as the Tribal Council deems appropriate, in its sole and absolute discretion. Employees will be notified appropriately of such changes.</p>
                <p class="quote">These policies and procedures shall apply to all employees of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="quote">

                <p class="quote">The following terms are used throughout this Manual:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">1.</span> <strong>"Tribal Council"</strong> means the governing body for the Pueblo.  This Personnel Policy has been approved and adopted by the Pueblo Tribal Council.  In case of conflict between this Personnel Policy and Tribal Ordinances and By-Laws, the Tribal Council will evaluate the conflict and make decision regarding which provision shall prevail.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">2.</span> <strong>"Governor" </strong>means the elected official of the Pueblo in charge of all programs, employees, and operations, and the direct supervisor of the Tribal Administrator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">3.</span> <strong>"Tribal Administrator" </strong>means the individual who administers the day-to-day operations, business and fiscal affairs, and other management function associated with the administration of the Pueblo and who supervises all Directors.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">4.</span> <strong>"Director" </strong>means the person charged with the management and budget functions of individual departments and/or programs of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">5.</span> <strong>"Supervisor"</strong> means the individual to whom any employee directly reports and receives directions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">6.</span> <strong>"Coordinator" </strong>means an individual responsible for the overall function of the program and provides administrative direction/support and technical assistance to all staff.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">9.</span> <strong>"At-Will" </strong>means an employee is free to resign at any time; and the Pueblo is free to terminate employment at any time, with or without cause.</p>
                <p class="quote">
                  <strong>GENERAL EMPLOYMENT POLICIES</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                  <strong>101. Nature of Employment</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">Employment with the Pueblo is "at-will" so that employment is voluntarily entered into by the employee and the employee is free to resign at any time, with or without cause. Similarly, the Pueblo is free to terminate the employment at any time, with or without cause.  Employees may be given the right to pursue grievance procedures.</p>
                <p class="quote">This Policy is not a contract. The policies set forth are not intended to create a contract, nor are they to be construed to constitute contractual obligations, express or implied, to remain employed by the Pueblo. Nor does it guarantee any fixed terms or conditions of employment. Nothing in any policy or work rule of the Pueblo shall alter the at-will employment relationship between the Pueblo and its employees.</p>
                <p class="quote">This Policy is intended to provide employees with a general understanding of employment with the Pueblo. However, this Policy cannot anticipate every situation or answer every question about employment. Therefore, in order to retain necessary flexibility in the administration of policies and procedures, the Pueblo reserves the right to alter, delete, or add to any of the provisions of the Policy and to change, modify, suspend, cancel or interpret any of the personnel policies and practices or employee benefits which are described herein without notice to employees whenever the Tribal Council determines, in its sole discretion, that such action is warranted and without having to give cause or justification or consideration to any employee.</p>
                <p class="quote">These provisions supersede all existing policies and practices and may not be amended or added to without the express written approval of the Pueblo Tribal Council. It is the responsibility of the Tribal Administrator to notify all employees of changes made to the content of the Policy in a timely fashion.</p>
                <p class="quote">
                  <strong>102. Equal Employment Opportunity</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">In order to provide equal employment and advancement opportunities to all individuals, employment decisions at the Pueblo will be based on performance, job qualifications, and experience. The Pueblo does not discriminate in employment opportunities or practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, ancestry, disability, or any other characteristic protected by law. However, the Pueblo will give preference in employment to qualified American Indians and Pueblo Tribal members as described by the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act and other applicable laws.</p>
                <p class="quote">This policy applies to all employment practices, including recruiting, hiring, evaluation, promotion, transfer, discipline and termination, as well as all forms of employee compensation. All of the Pueblo's policies will be interpreted to permit and promote reasonable accommodation of the disabilities and religious beliefs and practices of otherwise qualified employees and applicants, except where such accommodation causes undue hardship to the Pueblo. The extent of an obligation is determined by the Pueblo of San Ildefonso's needs, financial costs and expense, in conformity with applicable law.</p>
                <p class="quote">Every employee is expected to conform to this policy, to accomplish work in a professional and businesslike manner, and to be courteous to all other employees, contractors, business associates, customers, guests, and visitors at all times. Discrimination against or harassment of any employee or other person because of race, color, religion, creed, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry or disability is strictly prohibited.</p>
                <p class="quote">
                  <strong>103. Business Ethics and Conduct</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">The successful operation and reputation of the Pueblo is built upon the principles of fair dealing and ethical conduct of our employees. Employees owe a duty to the Pueblo, its community members and the Tribal Council to act in a way that will merit the continued trust and confidence of the public. Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a positive and professional manner so as to promote the best interests of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="quote">The Pueblo will comply with all applicable laws and regulations and expects its employees to conduct business in accordance with the letter, spirit, and intent of all applicable laws and regulations and to refrain from any illegal, dishonest, or unethical conduct.</p>
                <p class="quote">In general, the use of good judgment, based on high ethical principles, will guide employees with respect to lines of acceptable conduct. If a situation arises where it is difficult to determine the proper course of action, the matter will be referred to the Tribal Administrator who will make a final determination on the issue. Conduct that interferes with operations, discredits, or is offensive the Pueblo, the public, or fellow employees will not be tolerated.</p>
                <p class="quote">
                  <strong>104. Conflicts of Interest</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="quote">Employees have an obligation to conduct business within guidelines that prohibit actual or potential conflicts of interest. Employees are expected, at all times, to act in the best interest of the Pueblo.</p>
                <p class="quote">Transactions with outside firms<sup>-</sup> must be conducted within a framework established and controlled by the Governor of the Pueblo. Business dealings with outside firms should not result in unusual gains for those firms or employees. Unusual gain refers to bribes, product bonuses, special fringe benefits, unusual price breaks, and other windfalls designed to ultimately benefit the employer, the employee, or both. Plans that could be interpreted to involve unusual gain require specific approval from the Tribal Council.</p>
                <p class="quote">An actual or potential conflict of interest occurs when an employee is in a position to influence a decision that may result in a personal gain for that employee or for a relative as a result of the Pueblo's business dealings.</p>
                <p class="quote">However, if employees have any influence on transactions involving purchases, contracts, or leases, it is imperative that they disclose to the Tribal Administrator the existence of any actual or potential conflict of interest so that safeguards can be established to protect all parties.</p>

                <p class="quote">The Human Resources Director is the designated Suitability Official who determines suitability of prospective employees for employment and efficiency of service. The Pueblo may appoint one additional Suitability Official. The Suitability determination process protects the interests of the Pueblo and the rights of applicants and employees. The Suitability Determination Process requires uniform evaluation to ensure fair and consistent judgment.</p>
                <p class="quote">The Suitability Official is the designated representative for the Pueblo who directs proper background investigations and suitability determinations.  The Suitability Official must be qualified for the position and the responsibilities of his/her office and must have a favorable background investigation and suitability determination.

All precautions shall be taken to guarantee confidentiality.</p>

A subordinate should not make a suitability determination for his/her immediate supervisor.</p>

                <p class="quote">The assessment of suitability is made to establish a reasonable expectation that the employment or continued employment of a person either would or would not promote the interests and the efficiency of the Pueblo. This determination is based on considerations of whether the conduct of the person indicates a potential for behavior which would interfere with, prevent, or otherwise impact adversely on (1) the performance of the person in the position applied for or employed in; (2) the accomplishment of the duties and responsibilities of others in the Pueblo; or (3) the ability of the Pueblo to fully and effectively carry out its mandated responsibilities.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">(1)</span> Whether the conduct in question indicates a potential for inadequate or reduced accomplishment of specific duties; and (2) whether the conduct indicates any immediate or long-term risk for abuse of trust in carrying out the responsibilities of the position.

                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">a.</span> Delinquency or misconduct in prior employment;</p>

                <p class="quote">The Suitability Official shall consider the following additional factors to the extent that these factors are deemed pertinent to the individual case:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">a.</span> The kind of position for which the person is applying or in which the person is employed, including its trust risks;</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 quote"><span class="level-num">g.</span> The absence or presence of rehabilitation or efforts toward rehabilitation.</p>
                <p class="quote">The Suitability Official shall determine suitability and complete a Certificate of Investigation form identifying the written investigation reports and verbal references received and favorable determination of suitability.  The Suitability Official must obtain concurrence on a suitability decision from the Governor or Lt. Governor.  The Certificate of Investigation is signed and dated by the Suitability Official and the Governor or Lt. Governor and placed in the employee's personnel file.  The supporting documentation to the favorable determination can then be destroyed.  The appropriate personnel will be notified that the employee has been cleared.</p>
                <p class="quote">In cases in which the Suitability Official with the concurrence of the Governor or Lt. Governor determines that the individual does not meet the character requirements and is unacceptable for employment, appropriate personnel will be notified and all documents supporting this unacceptable determination will be kept in a secure locked file.</p>
                <p class="quote">In cases in which a former employee of the Pueblo requires a reference regarding new employment, such reference request must be submitted in writing to the Human Resources Department.  The response of the Human Resources Department shall be in writing and, except as otherwise required by law, will be limited to confirming only dates of employment, wage rates, and position(s) held. If a former employee would like the prospective employer to be provided with more information, that former employee must provide a written and signed authorization and release to their prior direct supervisor.</p>

                <p class="quote">Although the Pueblo has no prohibition against hiring relatives of existing employees, we are committed to monitoring situations in which relatives work in the same area. The employment of relatives in the same area of an organization may cause serious conflicts and problems with favoritism and employee morale. In addition to claims of partiality in treatment at work, personal conflicts from outside the work environment can be carried into day-to-day working relationships.</p>
                <p class="quote">In case of actual or potential problems between or among relatives who work in the same area, the Pueblo may monitor the problem and may take prompt action to attempt to resolve the problem. This may include reassignment or, if necessary because no resolution is possible, one or both employees may be required to resign or be terminated.</p>
                <p class="quote">A "relative" as used in this Policy is any person who is related by blood or marriage in the immediate family or whose relationship with the employee is similar to that of persons who are related by blood or marriage.

                <p class="quote"><strong>Contract: </strong>A contract employee is an individual who provides services as stipulated in a contract/subcontract agreement and is not eligible for the rights and benefits of Pueblo. All employee contracts shall be reviewed and approved by the Governor and Tribal Administrator.  All proper documentation shall be submitted to the Tribal Administrator including the contract and budget justification.</p>
                <p class="quote"><strong>Probationary: </strong>Employees whose performance is being evaluated to determine whether further employment in a specific position with the Pueblo is appropriate. Employees who satisfactorily complete the probationary period of ninety (90) calendar days will be notified of their new employment classification. The probationary period may be extended to continue assessment of the employee's performance. The probationary period will be extended by the same amount of days that have been authorized and taken as leave during the probationary period as described in Section 303. The employee shall be terminated if job performance during the probationary period is not satisfactory. Probationary employees accrue annual and sick leave from the date of hire, however, use of such leave by probationary employees during the probationary period is not authorized except in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the immediate supervisor and the Tribal Administrator.</p>
                <p class="quote"><strong>Temporary: </strong>Employees who are hired as interim replacements to temporarily supplement the work force, or to assist in the completion of a specific project or as an emergency hire. Employment assignments in this category are of a limited duration (90-Day or unless a waiver granted for the Governor for an extension). Employment beyond any initially stated period does not in any way imply a change in employment status. Temporary employees retain that status unless and until notified of a change. Temporary employees are ineligible for the Pueblo's benefits, unless otherwise expressly provided.</p>
                <p class="quote"><strong>Exempt Employees</strong>:  Employees in positions classified in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA is the acronym for Federal Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended), are exempt and shall not be eligible for overtime pay because of supervisory, managerial, professional, or otherwise exercise independent judgment and discretion in the performance of their job duties.

                <p class="quote">The probationary period is intended to give new employees the opportunity to demonstrate their ability to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and to determine whether the new position meets their expectations. The Pueblo de San Ildefonso uses this period to evaluate employees' capabilities, work habits, and overall performance. All new, transferred and rehired employees work on a probationary basis for the first ninety (90) calendar days after their date of hire or transfer.</p>
                <p class="quote">A probationary employee may be terminated or transferred at will during the probationary period when his or her abilities or performance are judged insufficient by the immediate supervisor. Transferred employees may be reinstated to their former positions, or an equivalent position they are qualified for, provided such a position is available.</p>
                <p class="quote">New employees are not eligible to receive benefits within the probationary period. New employees will accrue annual and sick leave from the date of hire but are generally not eligible to use or be paid for such leave during the probationary period except in extraordinary circumstances as determined by the immediate supervisor and Tribal Administrator.</p>
                <p class="quote">Upon satisfactory completion of the probationary period, the probationary employee shall become either a Regular Full-Time or Regular Part-Time employee. However, successful completion of the probationary period does not modify or change the employee's "at-will" status and does not entitle an employee to an automatic increase in pay for the change to a "regular employee" status.</p>

Additional formal performance evaluations are conducted to provide both Directors and employees the opportunity to discuss job tasks, identify and correct weaknesses, encourage and recognize strengths, and discuss positive, purposeful approaches for meeting goals. This clause applies to new hires, rehires and transferred employees.</p>

                <p class="quote">The Pueblo has a strong commitment to the health, safety, and welfare of its employees, their families, and its constituents. Widely available statistics and  information establish that the incidence of drug and alcohol abuse is increasing and that the effect is devastating to lives, business, and the community at large. The Pueblo is concerned that due to the potential for</p>
                <p class="quote">abuse among some of our employees, the safety of our employees and the general public could be endangered. Our commitment to maintaining a safe and secure workplace requires a clear policy and supportive programs relating to the detection, treatment, and prevention of substance</p>

The applicant's signature on the employment application is an agreement by that applicant to submit to pre-employment drug testing. Any applicant who tests positive in the pre-employment drug test shall be rejected and shall be ineligible for hire for 12months unless the applicant adequately establishes a legal basis for the use of the drug or controlled substance with respect to which the</p>

After successful completion of all requirements of this section, employees will again be subject to the testing program applicable to all employees.

An employee filing a grievance shall be free from restraint, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal.  The Pueblo recognizes the importance of open communication in resolving disputes.  All complaints shall receive full and fair consideration.  The grievance process shall be kept confidential and all communications, documents, and records relating to a grievance shall be kept in a separate file and maintained by the Human Resources Department.</p>

The Supervisor shall promptly inform his/her supervisor and the HR in writing that an aggrieved employee has requested a meeting to discuss an issue.  The aggrieved employee and Supervisor shall promptly meet to discuss and attempt to resolve the matter.  If the matter cannot be resolved informally, or if the employee does not believe that a discussion with their Supervisor is appropriate, then an aggrieved employee shall be required to go through the following steps to file a formal grievance or to appeal a grievance decision:</p>

That supervisor shall make a decision regarding the grievance, in writing, within three (3) calendar days after the meeting and shall notify the aggrieved employee of the decision in person and by mail.  That supervisor shall provide a copy of the decision to the Human Resources Department.  If that supervisor fails to act in a timely manner, then the employee may proceed to Step 3.</p>

Filing must take place within five (5) calendar days after supervisor's decision or, in case of no action, within five (5) calendar days after the final day of the supervisor's decision-making time limit.</p>
                <p class="quote">The HR Director shall schedule a meeting with the aggrieved employee and the Supervisor within five (5) calendar days of the appeal. The aggrieved employee may present witnesses and other evidence in a reasonable manner.</p>

                <p class="quote">The Ad Hoc committee shall make a decision regarding the grievance, in writing, within three (3) calendar days after the meeting and shall notify the aggrieved employee of the decision in person and by mail.
